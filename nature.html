            Nature, in the broadest sense, is equivalent to the natural world, physical world,<br>
            or material world."Nature" refers to the phenomena of the physical world, and also <br>
            to life in general. It ranges in scale from the subatomic to the cosmic. <br>
        </p>
        <p id ="two">
            The term "nature" may refer to living plants and animals, geological processes, weather, <br>
            and physics, such as matter and energy. The term is often refers to the "natural environment" <br> 
            or wildernessâ€”wild animals, rocks, forest, beaches, and in general areas that have not been <br>
            substantially altered by humans, or which persist despite human intervention. <br>
        </p>
        <p id="three">
            For, example, manufactured objects and human interaction are generally not considered <br>
            part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". <br>
        </p>
        <p id="four">
            This more traditional concept of "nature" implies a distinction between natural and <br>
            artificial elements of the Earth, with the artificial as that which has been <br>
            brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind. <br>

            Earth is the only planet presently known to support life, and its natural features are <br>
            the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the solar system, <br>
            it is third nearest to the sun; it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall. <br>
            Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate <br>
            zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region. <br>
        </p>
        <p id="six">
            Precipitation varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less <br>
            than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. <br>
            The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the <br>
            Northern Hemisphere. <br>
